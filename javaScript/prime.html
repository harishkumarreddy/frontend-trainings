->> Print first 10 prime numbers
-- prime numiber is a natural numbe and shuld be divisible by 1 and it self ex 1 x 5 and 5 x 1.
-- 0 to 50
    --- steps:
        1.take each number from natural numbers
        2.check the number is greaterthan 1 or not.
        3.if the number is greaterthan 1, check whether it is divisable 
            with all posibles from 1 to the taken number
        4.if the divisable count is 2, treat that it is a prime number
        5.repete the same process until you get 10 primenumbers

?? is that the limit fixed as 10 or dynamic in the future?
---> yes but might be later.

Programetical algoritham:
1. create a variable and take the value 2. coz, primary roule is greaterthan 1.
2  ->> 2 ---> is prime
        2%1 => 0
        2%2 => 0

    ->> 3 ---> prime number
        3%1 => 0
        3%2 => 0.69
        3%3 => 0
    ->> 4 not a prime
        4%1 ==>0
        4%2 ==>0
        4%3 ==>~1
        4%4 => 0

        ......
    Keep this in a loop until the count of marked as prime numbers reach the boundry.
    Print the list of prime number.
